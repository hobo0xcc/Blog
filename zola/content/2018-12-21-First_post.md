Hello, world!

I am a Japanese student, mainly interested in programming language and operating system.

I am studying English because i do not have English as my mother tongue.

In this blog, i will write articles of computer science in English, and articles of (real) language that i am learning in Japanese.

If you find typos and mistakes and others, please let me known on [my twitter](https://twitter.com/hobo0xcc) or in [Github repository](https://github.com/hobo0xcc/Blog) of this blog.
